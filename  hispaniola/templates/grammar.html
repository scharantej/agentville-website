<h1>Basic Spanish Grammar</h1>
<p>This page provides an overview of basic Spanish grammar. It covers topics such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.</p>
<h2>Nouns</h2>
<p>Nouns are words that name things, people, places, or ideas. In Spanish, nouns are either masculine or feminine. Masculine nouns are typically preceded by the article "el," while feminine nouns are typically preceded by the article "la."</p>
<p>For example, "el libro" (the book) is a masculine noun, while "la mesa" (the table) is a feminine noun.</p>
<h2>Verbs</h2>
<p>Verbs are words that describe actions or states of being. In Spanish, verbs are conjugated to indicate tense, mood, and person.</p>
<p>For example, the verb "hablar" (to speak) can be conjugated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yo hablo (I speak)</li>
<li>Tú hablas (you speak)</li>
<li>Él habla (he speaks)</li>
<li>Ella habla (she speaks)</li>
<li>Nosotros hablamos (we speak)</li>
<li>Vosotros habláis (you speak)</li>
<li>Ellos hablan (they speak)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adjectives</h2>
<p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns. In Spanish, adjectives typically come after the noun they modify.</p>
<p>For example, "el libro rojo" (the red book) is an adjective followed by a noun.</p>
<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<p>Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. In Spanish, adverbs typically come before the word they modify.</p>
<p>For example, "muy bien" (very well) is an adverb that modifies the verb "hablar" (to speak).</p>
