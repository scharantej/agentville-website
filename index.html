  <h1>Autonomous Agents</h1>
  <p>Autonomous agents are software programs that can operate without human intervention. They are able to make decisions and take actions on their own, based on their programming and the information they receive from their environment.</p>
  <p>Autonomous agents are used in a variety of applications, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
    <li>Customer service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The potential applications of autonomous agents are vast. As these agents become more sophisticated, they will be able to perform a wider range of tasks and make more complex decisions. This will have a major impact on our lives, changing the way we work, play, and interact with the world around us.</p>
