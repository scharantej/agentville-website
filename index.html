  <h1>Autonomous Agents</h1>
  <p>Autonomous agents are software programs that can operate without human intervention. They are able to make decisions and take actions on their own, based on their programming and the information they receive from their environment.</p>
  <p>Autonomous agents are used in a variety of applications, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
    <li>Customer service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The development of autonomous agents is a rapidly growing field, and there are many exciting possibilities for the future of this technology.</p>
