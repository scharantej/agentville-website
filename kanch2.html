                    <p class="card-text">Today 78% of workers in the private sector can take a paid sick day, compared to 63% in 2010, the EPI said, citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of low-wage workers rose the most because they were the least likely to have any sick leave. Still, an overwhelming majority of these lowest-paid workers — 61% — can't ...</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Figure A below breaks down access to paid sick days: Whereas 96% of the highest-wage workers (top 10%) had access to paid sick days, only 39% of the lowest-paid workers (bottom 10%) are able to earn paid sick days. That means the highest-wage workers are 2.5 times as likely to have access to paid sick leave as the lowest-paid workers.</p>
